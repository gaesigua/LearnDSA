//        Before we implement the Bubble Sort algorithm in a programming language, let's manually run through a short array only one time, just to get the idea.

//    Step 1: We start with an unsorted array.

//            [7, 12, 9, 11, 3]

//    Step 2: We look at the two first values. Does the lowest value come first? Yes, so we don't need to swap them.

//            [7, 12, 9, 11, 3]

//    Step 3: Take one step forward and look at values 12 and 9. Does the lowest value come first? No.

//            [7, 12, 9, 11, 3]

//    Step 4: So we need to swap them so that 9 comes first.

//            [7, 9, 12, 11, 3]

//    Step 5: Taking one step forward, looking at 12 and 11.

//            [7, 9, 12, 11, 3]

//    Step 6: We must swap so that 11 comes before 12.

//            [7, 9, 11, 12, 3]

//    Step 7: Looking at 12 and 3, do we need to swap them? Yes.

//            [7, 9, 11, 12, 3]

//    Step 8: Swapping 12 and 3 so that 3 comes first.

//            [7, 9, 11, 3, 12]

    }
